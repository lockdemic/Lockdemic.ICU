2022-04-10,上海,Shanghai,上海男子晕倒未能获得及时抢救，数小时后在自家楼道失去生命体征 #17,"A Shanghai man collapsed and failed to receive timely rescue. Hours later, he lost his life signs in his corridor",我爸在4月11日下午4点45分的时候，因咳嗽咳得严重，感觉身体吃不消了，打了120，120过来了，说没有医院收，居委会也说没地方送，搞了一个多小时还是让我爸回家了，我爸路也走不动，到了5楼直接晕倒了，房客不敢动我爸，让他躺5楼的楼道里，晚上7点01分又打了120，7点32分120到了，说我爸已无生命体征，随即送我爸去了同济医院抢救，9点16分抢救无效死亡！我爸就这样活活被拖死了！四点多的时候人还能说话走路，你们不送医院，人死了有地方抢救了？！难道非要把人逼死，医院才收么？！,"At 4:45 p.m. on April 11, my dad had a severe cough and felt that his body couldn’t take it anymore. He called 120, and he came over. He said that there was no hospital to accept it. The neighborhood committee also said that there was no place to deliver it. I still let my dad go home after an hour. My dad couldn't walk. He fainted when he reached the 5th floor. The tenant didn't dare to touch my dad, so he let him lie down in the corridor on the 5th floor. , arrived at 120 at 7:32, and said that my father had no vital signs, and immediately sent my father to Tongji Hospital for rescue. At 9:16, the rescue failed and he died! My dad was dragged to death like this! At four o'clock, people can still talk and walk. You don't send them to the hospital. Is there a place to rescue people when they die? ! Do you have to force people to death before the hospital accepts them? !",https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4757216269435199,,1,https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103404386/163624272-a83461cf-6997-453c-b17a-0ba143fe367b.png
