Basic principles of “disaster relief”: secondary disasters caused by disaster relief should not exceed the disaster itself.

The secondary disasters caused by the extreme lockdown far outweighed Omicron itself.

## Deaths from secondary disasters due to extreme lockdown measures:

###### For the time being, only celebrities, medical workers, and other incidents of death or sacrifice from extreme epidemic prevention or lockdown measures that have received public and media attention can be counted. It is still difficult to count the real number of civilian deaths in secondary disasters caused by the closure of the city. In the statistical sense of public health, the actual number of cases is generally much higher than the number of cases that have received widespread public and media attention. If there are any unlisted case clues, please submit them in the Issues area: https://github.com/lockdemic/Lockdemic.ICU/issues

Since the spread of Omicron around the world, while the infectivity of the new crown variant has increased significantly, the virus toxicity, severe rate, and fatality rate have all shown a cliff-like decline. In countries with high rates of effective vaccination, the public health hazard and fatality rate have been "relatively lower than seasonal influenza"*. Economic recovery, shift of policy focus, and recovery of the job market have become the main themes of the global economy and people's livelihood in 2022.

In 2020, in the face of the original strain of the new crown with a very high fatality rate and a transmission rate far lower than that of Omicron, we effectively blocked the initial rampage of the original strain of the new crown by blocking the entire city of Wuhan with an iron fist. The heroic people of Wuhan paid a huge price, but they persevered and united to win the first battle against the epidemic in the face of the original strain of the new crown with a high lethality rate. It has maintained the normal and stable operation of the economy while ensuring the lives and health of the people across the country. The initial closure measures not only preserved the overall situation of preventing and controlling the original strain of the new crown, but also preserved the economic life on which thousands of households depended for their livelihoods, demonstrating my country's institutional advantages and the people's positive attitude towards scientific epidemic prevention.

Time passes. In 2022, in the face of the influenza-grade variant Omikron, which has completely different characteristics from the original strain of the new crown, the one-size-fits-all city closure policy has not only not undergone major adjustments, but has even continued to increase layer by layer in major, medium and small cities across the country. The most ironic thing is that while the vast majority of patients infected with Omicron quickly recovered without leaving any sequelae, the number of secondary disaster victims and even the death toll caused by the increasingly extreme lockdown measures has risen sharply. , its damage is far higher than the seriousness and death caused by Omicron itself in most of the time.

Secondary disasters caused by disaster relief should not exceed the disaster itself. The vast number of medical workers and many grass-roots medical staff who participated in the treatment in person on the front line raised their voices in the face of the unreasonable and unscientific extreme epidemic prevention measures against Omicron, but they were drowned in the mighty "clearing". "In anger. At the same time, some cities are actively or passively using iron-fisted measures against the original strain of the virus to prevent and control Omicron, which brings inefficient prevention and control, on-site aggregation of nucleic acids, material shortages, mass starvation, and separation of flesh and blood. , the unnatural deaths of residents and other malignant secondary disasters intensified. The economic source on which a large number of people at the lowest level depend for their survival has been interrupted, and they have lost their voices in the mainstream media, and have fallen into a real spiral survival crisis. And many middle-income families and even high-income families in areas where the city is strictly closed also have to worry about whether they can eat their next meal, whether the elderly at home can survive the food shortage, and the hospitals are distressed, angry, And helpless. It is hard to imagine this happening in the middle-income countries of the twenty-first century. However, effective anti-epidemic measures for the Omic Army, such as greatly increasing the rate of effective vaccination, graded diagnosis and treatment, home isolation, and new changes in popularizing the epidemic to eliminate unnecessary fears of the public, are not only not gradually implemented during 2021-2022, but even until There is no current intention to show any improvement in this direction either. Almost all the energy of middle-level and grass-roots staff is trapped in the repeated and strengthened city closure measures, and they are forced to fall into a vicious circle of tactical diligence and strategic laziness.

At the same time, some capital spokesmen and those in power who rely on additional lockdown measures to boost their wealth or power are controlling domestic public opinion, spreading rumors about the achievements of the Omicron International epidemic prevention, including the vast number of third world countries, and fully aware of the epidemic prevention measures. While morphological, the voices of the people at the bottom who are caught in the secondary disaster of the city closure cannot be heard or even actively blocked. A Chinese medicine manufacturer even joined hands to concoct fake news that the World Health Organization "recommends" the use of a Chinese medicine preparation to fight the epidemic. ** Others, especially in the small power centers at the grass-roots level, took the opportunity to seek rent-seeking power, block power, and disregard the basic principles of a rule-of-law society during the fight against the epidemic. All of these, while deceiving the public and deceiving the society, they also continue to delay the timely and effective adjustment of anti-epidemic measures in accordance with science, which not only kidnapped the people's health and economic life, but also kidnapped the national epidemic prevention policy.

In order to prevent the tragedy from continuing and leave a complete memory of history, the Lockdemic.ICU project will do its best to faithfully record the abnormal deaths caused by this excessive lockdown movement. It is hoped that this project will make more people realize that our opponent and partner in epidemic prevention is nature, and the enemy of epidemic prevention is by no means the demonized scientific means of epidemic prevention and the "Western" epidemic prevention model, let alone living in the next residential area or the next city. , relatives and compatriots in neighboring provinces! Omicron is not the original strain of the new crown. As the virus continues to decrease in toxicity and infectivity continues to increase, unnecessary fear will only bring endless repeated city closures and secondary disasters with no upper limit, so that the country is caught in fire and water, If you and I live in fire and water, and the economy collapses, people will starve to death on a large scale and die of disease. The current bad situation has just begun, and we still have the opportunity to make adjustments in time to save the building. Abandon politics in command, respect science, respect front-line medical personnel, and respect the opinions of professional medical workers. And if the madness continues, you and I will both become victims of this movement. The poor will lose their jobs, sources of income, and even seriously ill family members with various diseases, while the rich will fly away, abandoning this land and taking away capital and technical management experience. Next pile of mess. Even if someone is ultimately responsible for this crazy farce, the damage it causes will be irreparable.

It is hoped that scientific epidemic prevention, greatly increasing the effective vaccination rate, graded diagnosis and treatment, home isolation, and popularizing new changes in the epidemic will eliminate unnecessary fears of the public, and this can be realized as soon as possible in our land. At a critical moment, it is not shameful to "copy homework" from the public health sciences and the excellent people in Omicron's epidemic prevention.
